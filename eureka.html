						<p>
						Eureka is an activity centered social media platform that aims to help people establish more personalized and meaningful connections. Users are able to discover activities which they may be interested in that are happening around them. And through these activities, connect with people that share similar interests.

						<h1>Market Research</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="description col-9">
						<p>
						The idea of social media is much more popular than the idea of social networks. Social Media is defined as a mixture of communication + publishing, whereas social network aims to connect people with the same interests. Most major companies have started as social networking centered but because of the advancement of technology, they’ve all deviated to the nature of social media. We believe that what people want but are lack of are to find people with common interests and establish real-world and meaningful interactions in addition to online communications.
						</p>
						<p>
						We realized that a majority of connections we make are not meaningful and long-lasting because they’re not brought together by specific common interests. We believe that there should be a way for people who share very similar interests that would actually lead them to put time and effort into doing an activity together. Eureka tackles the problem of meaningless connections online and lack of common interests offline by offering a fix to social networks.

						<h4>Features</h4>
						<p>
						This platform is meant for casual hangouts/activities like game night, karaoke, kickbacks instead of events like festivals and workshops. We are focusing on smaller group activities that would lead to more meaningful connection establishments. We are giving our users a place to create their own activities in which they would like more people to participate, or join events that they are interested in to meet more people with similar interests. 
						</p>
						<h4>Competitive Edge</h4>
						<p>
						We consider ourselves standing at the crossroad of traditional social networking/media and activity publishing services, especially with a focus to bring online connections to offline face-to-face interaction

						<h1>Promotion Plan</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="description col-9">
						<h4>Stage 1</h4>
						<p>
						In order to gain insight into market trends and customer behaviors, we aim to distribute surveys and focus groups. The survey will be asking about user behaviors and impressions on both the competitors and Eureka. Using the data collected, we will be able to analyze and understand what features are needed and what is not. 
						</p>
						<h4>Stage 2</h4>
						<p>
						Since we are an activity-based platform, we plan to host fun events and activities on campus through the app so the current users can experience the app thoroughly and potential users would see the events and be interested in downloading and using it. The reason why promotional events would be executed first instead of introducing the actual application is that events would generate more interests and buzz around this new concept.
						</p>
						<h4>Stage 3</h4>
						<p>
						Afterwards, we will promote the application itself. It would be the same channels as the advertisement but this time, it would be introducing the app. In terms of marketing content, we could show photographs, videos, and stories of people who had already downloaded the application during the promotional event stage and how Eureka has helped them meet new people and added more colors to their social lives. This way, we not only have real-life examples of Eureka’s features, but we would also already have user-generated content on the app. 
						</p>
						<h4>Stage 4</h4>
						<p>
						After we have reached a certain amount of popularity, we would collaborate with restaurants, salons, etc. to incorporate advertisements on the app.
